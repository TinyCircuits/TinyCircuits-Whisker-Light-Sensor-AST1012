# TinyCircuits Wireling Light Sensor
# AST1012 Rev2

The design files are located under design_files/ for the TinyCircuits AST1012 Rev 2 PCB. This is a Wireling board which features the AMS TSL2572 ambient light sensor with built in UV rejection filter and is also capable of operating in IR light environments. Its high sensitivity range enables it to operate even behind dark glass (such as in portable applications like Smartphones).

Format is in Cadsoft Eagle format - Eagle version 6.2 was used for the original design.

This project uses designs and concepts developed as part of the Arduino project and the LilyPad project.  The TinyCircuits design files themselves (schematics, PCB and libraries) are not directly derived from these works' design files and have been created new, however the concepts and basic architecture behind the TinyDuino and TinyLily products are derived and we thank the hard work of the organizations below for their contributions to open-source hardware:
